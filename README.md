# Reverse-Engineering the Vector Watch

This repository contains resources on reverse-engineering the Vector Watch (starting from the Luna), with an express result of loading custom firmware. With [Vector being aquired by Fitbit](http://vectorwatch.com/fitbit), the future of the platform is uncertain.

This is an on-going project. Most current information will be posted in the Wiki.
